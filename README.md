## Why Mathium?

Mathium provides an efficient, powerful, yet simple toolkit to construct powerful applications that require mathematical and computational functions and formulas in their codebase. It encourages simplicity, ease-of-use, and piece of mind, allowing developers to focus on what really matters. Mathium will provide a wide-array of mathematical and omputational-based frmulas to choose from, filled with endless adaptability and customizability.

## TypeScript

Mathium is not only designed and optimized to work with JavaScript, but with TypeScript as well. With cohesive and seamless imports and functionality, Mathium scales with you and your TypeScript applications.

## Get Started

Ensure that you have the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org) installed.

### 1. Installation with npm

```
npm i mathiumjs
```

### 2. Initialization

At the top of your TypeScript file, import `mathiumjs`, as shown:

```ts
import Mathium from "mathiumjs";
```

NOTE: The name `Mathium` after `import` is arbitrary; it can be replaced with whatever you'd like and the code will still run properly:

```ts
import Foo from "mathiumjs";
```
